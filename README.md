# Personalized-Drug-Side-Effects-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning

## Description
A machine learning-based system for predicting personalized drug side effects using patient demographics, medical history, and drug interactions. Includes a dataset for training and evaluation.

## About the Project  

Side effects of drugs vary based on patient-specific factors such as age, weight, medical history, and drug interactions. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict these effects accurately, helping doctors and patients make informed decisions.

## Dataset Details  

The dataset contains 7,386+ records with the following key features:

- **Age (Numeric)** - Patient's age

- **Weight (Numeric)** - Patient's weight in kg

- **Height (Numeric)** - Patient's height in cm

- **Medical Condition (Categorical)** - Condition being treated

- **Medical History (Text/None)** - Past medical records (some missing values)

- **Drug Name (Categorical)** - Name of the prescribed drug

- **Dosage (Numeric)** - Amount of drug administered

- **Duration (Numeric)** - How long the drug was taken (in days)

- **Side Effects Experienced (Categorical/None)** - Reported side effects (some missing values)

## Technologies Used

- Python

- TensorFlow (for deep learning models)

- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)

- Scikit-learn (for ML modeling)

- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
